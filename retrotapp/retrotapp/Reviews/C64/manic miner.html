    			<p>You control a miner called Willy.  The aim of the game is to get through different areas in the mine by collecting 5 keys and heading for the portal, all while avoiding enemies and collapsing platforms. My favourite level is 5 because it has killer toilets!</p>

    			<p>When you first start you think to yourself "OK,what should I do now?", then you try out the buttons and figure it out!.  The first level is hard for me but maybe for you it is easy or just right. Although it is hard, some of the obstacles and enemies are easy and some are hard, for example on level 5 there is a massive ghost man in your way, which is really annoying when you need to get to the other side!</p>

	    		<p>The game is really fun to play, even if you have just had you first game over screen.  The graphics are OK and the sound is pretty terrible (especially the jumping sound).  You do get bored quickly when you first start but when you are familiar with the controls you want to keep playing and playing until the end.</p>

    			<p>There are some things that could be improved - the worst thing is the sound of the jumping.  The controls are awkward to get used to because when you need to jump it doesn't always jump.  The game is very repetitive and it is frustrating because you need to get the keys again each time you lose a life, although it is good because you get to practice again.  It is a bit too complicated and I would like it easier.</p>

				<h2>The Verdict</h2>

					Your should play to get entertained and learn about retro.  Also don't give up on the first level, if you keep trying you can do it!
