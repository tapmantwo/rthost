    			<p><strong>International Karate+</strong> is a game where you fight against 2 other fighters, using different kicks, punches and head-butts, scoring a point each time you hit another person. Each fight lasts for 30 seconds, and the fighter with the lowest score at the end is out of the next round.  If a player scores 6 points, the fight is over and that player is the winner.</p>
          <p>
          The game is either 1 player or 2 player.  Player 1 controls a man who is wearing a white suit, and if playing, Player 2 controls a man in red (otherwise red is controlled by the computer).  The computer always controls the third blue man.   In 2 player mode, if 1 of you is knocked out, the other player can still continue.
          As you fight, you collect points, and as you collect higher points, you earn higher level belts.</p>

    			<p>Every 3rd round is a bonus round where you have to use a shield to block balls that bounce at you from the left and right.  You collect 100 points for each ball you deflect and if the balls hit you, the bonus round is over and you move on to your next fight.</p>

	    		<p>There are a number of different moves that you can do.  These can be a bit tricky to learn, but if you read the instructions, you can pick them up quite quickly.  My favourite move is the head-butt, because it gets you a lot of points, and it is also quite funny because it looks like the player is dancing.  Dad’s favourite move is the flying kick, because it looks cool! I think the difficulty level is just right.  You can keep playing over and over to try and get a better score.
It’s great fun in two player, and I really like knocking my Dad out :)</p>

    			<p>I like the graphics in the game, and the animation is very good.  The colours are nice and clear.  The background looks great, and has cool little animations like spiders coming down and fish jumping in the sea.  The music and sound effects are very good, and the sound when you hit an opponent makes you feel like you’ve really hit them. The game fun to play because you get to do cool moves, and you do want to keep playing until you beat your best score.  I like that you can change the speed of the game to make the players move faster or slower, and if you press the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>S</strong> keys at the same time, it makes the players trousers fall down which is really funny.</p>

				<h2>The Verdict</h2>
				<p>
					This game really feels like you are having a karate fight, and its great fun.  There is nothing I dislike about the game because it’s so good! You should play it!
