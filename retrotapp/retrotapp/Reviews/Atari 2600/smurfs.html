    			<p>You have to save Smurfette who is trapped in Gargamel's' castle. To get to Smurfette you go through several different zones, each one has a different obstacle, such as a spider in a cave. On some obstacles you have to double jump to get past them. Once you save her, you have to do it all over again, but it gets more difficult each time.

    			<p>Playing the game is great fun. When you rescue Smurfette, I bet you will say to yourself “Yes I did it, I got to Smurfette”.There are 5 zones in the first round (fence, river, spider cave and Gargamel’s castle), and each round has more zones and more obstacles.  My favourite zone is the spider cave because it is really good animation making the spider quite scary.</p>

	    		<p>I like the background because it is colourful, and the sky is my favourite part because it is well set out.  The graphics are clear, making it easy to see the obstacles and the enemies. The animation is great, I love the way the raven, snake, bat and the spider moves.</p>

    			<p>I personally think the difficulty is perfect.  You can get to Smurfette quite easily first time, but it gets harder and more challenging each time.  The controls are easy to learn, to double jump you have to move your joystick up then up again. To crouch pull your joystick down. To walk is left and right.</p>
