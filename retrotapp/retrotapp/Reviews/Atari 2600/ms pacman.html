    			<p>You control a yellow figure called <strong>Ms. Pacman</strong> and if you know who Pacman is, well she is him but with a pink bow on top of her head.
          The aim of the game is to collect (eat) dots and if you collect a big dot (power pill) you can eat the ghosts to give you points. When you’ve eaten all the dots the maze resets but you’ve still got your points and lives from the other maze.</p>

    			<p>I knew what to do straight away because I have already played Pacman.  I think the difficulty is just right and the controls are easy to get used to.
          The enemies are the ghosts, if you eat your way to them they will catch you and bash you and then you lose a life, which is really annoying.</p>

	    		<p>The game is fun to play and it is challenging to get to the next round.  I think that the graphics are really good compared to the original Pacman (on the Atari) and the sound when you eat the dots is OK, but the sound when you eat a ghost and get a power pill is good.
          You want to get to the next and the next round and when you do, it is a great achievement.</p>

    			<p>The game can get very repetitive because every round is the same.</p>

				<h2>The Verdict</h2>
				<p>
					You should play this game because it is entertaining, but if you are fussy about graphics and sounds then maybe this isn’t the game for you.
