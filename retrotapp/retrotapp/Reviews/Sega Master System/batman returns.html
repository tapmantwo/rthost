    			<p>In this game you are Batman, and you run, jump and swing through 5 stages, beating bad guys until you get to the Penguin.  Each stage has 2 different routes, one is easier and one is hard. They always end with a boss fight.  The bosses I have fought are a Fire-eater and Catwoman.  The end boss is the Penguin.

    			<p>Each stage has lots of bad guys and obstacles to clear.  You have the batarang which you can shoot the bad guys with and use to climb and swing across platforms.
There are lots of different types of bad guys â€“ some throw bombs, or jump out at you.  If they touch you or hit you with their weapons, you die and lose a life.</p>

	    		<p>You can collect power ups as you go through the levels that give you an extra life or make your weapon more powerful.
The game is hard but it is fun when you defeat a group of bad guys.  
The bosses are hard to fight and it feels good when you beat them.</p>

    			<p>The background graphics are superb (for master system :P). The sound &amp; music is good too.  The hard route is very difficult and I dislike the tricks they do on you: no floor, moving escalators and fire pits. I also dislike the big fat rolly guy.</p>

				<h2>The Verdict</h2>

					The game is tough but with some practise it becomes good fun.
