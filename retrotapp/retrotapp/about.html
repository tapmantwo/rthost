                    <p>
                        Richard set this up as a means to give his son Thomas an appreciation of the evolution of video games - how things compared to the games of today. He was interested to see how he reacted to simpler graphics, sound and long loading times - all of the things he happily suffered today.<br/>
                        The intent is not a simple "Play loads of games" thing, instead an examiniation of the games, what was good about them and what was bad about them.  Then through discussion and lots of fun, they can write up a review, which will also help Thomas develop some web skills.<br/>
                        Of course, it's not all educational - playing these games is (generally) great fun, and satisfying Richard's need to relive his youth.

                    <p>
                        I grew up in the 80s, with a <em>C64</em> being my first 'real' games machine.  I loved playing platformers, beat 'em ups and football sims, and would also enjoy typing in games listings from books and magazines.<br/>
                        I progressed onto the <em>Amiga</em>, <em>SNES</em>, and then onto <em>PC</em> and <em>Playstation</em>, and I now play contempory games on <em>XBOX 360</em> or my PC.<br/>
                        My all time favourite game would have to be the <em>Football Manager</em> series, closely followed by <em>Super Mario World</em>, <em>Street Fighter II</em> and <em>Final Fight</em>.<br/>

                    <h2>Bio: Thomas</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love playing video games, my favourites being <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Fifa</em>.  I do like all types of games though.<br/>
                        My favourite thing about playing retro games is the pixel art - I love being able to see how the characters have been drawn.<br/>
                        I think the <em>C64</em> is the best retro game console, and my favourite games for it are <em>Manic Miner</em>, and <em>Pac-Man</em>.<br/>
                        I really like <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> on the <em>Mega Drive</em> too.
